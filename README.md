# hello-world
New repository for first-time GitHub user.

I am a 33-year-old husband and father to a little girl, presently in the middle of a career change.  After 10 years in sales across various industries, I realized that I was never going to get much higher in a corporate food chain if I didn't go back to finish my education.  So, I quit my job and enrolled at OSU last January, completed my bachelor's degree in businesss management just a few weeks ago.  I have a job waiting for me that begins at the first of the year, and with the intervening months I am taking a 14-week web development course to learn how to code.
